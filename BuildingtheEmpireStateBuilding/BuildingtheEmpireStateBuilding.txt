Building a to-scale replica of the Empire State Building to thank our dear friend King Kong for his years of service in the B-movie industry.




To calculate the total volume of the Empire State building we need to calculate the volume of a lincoln log and then divide the volume of the Empire State building by that. Simple enough! :)


METHOD 1:


1. Because the Empire State building is simply a giant rectangle all we need to do is calculate the volume of a rectangle with the dimensions of the Empire State building. (I’m aware that there is an antenna but I couldn't find the dimensions for it). For this attempt I will be simplifying the problem and assuming that the length and width of the building are the same all the way up the building(they aren’t but this an estimation).
 
2.From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_State_Building I found out that from its base to its roof it has a height of 1,250 feet (381 m) and from its base to its antenna it has a height of 1,454 feet (443.2 m). The length (east-west) is 424 ft (129.2 m) and the width (north-south) is 187 ft (57.0 m).


        a. On WolframAlpha I input (height 381m * length 129.2m *         width 57m)
    [http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=height+of+381m+*+length+of+129.2m+*+width+of+57m]


         b. This gave me a volume of 2.806 * 10^6 cubic meters,         so about 2,806,000 cubic meters.


3.Finding official dimensions for Lincoln Logs was more difficult then I thought but I ended up using this guys DIY Lincoln log blog post: 
https://makesomething.tv/how-make-lincoln-logs for the dimensions. 


Going off of the average/medium lincoln log… each lincoln log is a basically a cylinder, with a length of 4 and 1/2 inches and a diameter of 3/4 inches.


I used WolframAlpha


[http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=volume+of+cylinder+with+length+4.5+inches+and+diameter+of+.75inches] 


to get the volume of the average Lincoln log and the result was 1.988 cubic inches. 


[In order to get a more exact measurement you would also have to find the diameter of the flat sides and subtract that from the overall volume.]


I then converted 1.988 cubic inches to meters and the resulting volume was 3.2577(10^-5)m^3 or about             
.000032577 m^3


5. So (volume of building/volume of legos)=(2,806,000/.00032577)=86,130,000,000m^3


        Converted back to inches the volume of that amount of lincoln logs is
    5,256,000,000,000,000in^3
        
    And then divided by the average volume of a lincoln log(1.988) which rounds to about:
    
    4,332,494,698 total medium sized logs to build a scale model that is really close to the dimensions of the empire state building. 




METHOD 2:


The Empire State Building is not a perfect rectangle, otherwise I would be able to calculate to volume very easily. After realizing this I did some research on other ways to calculate volume.It is possible to calculate volume by weight but it's dependent on the density of the materials used. I was able to find a list of the materials used from http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/buildingbig/wonder/structure/empire_state.html 


The Empire State Building is composed of 60,000 tons of steel, 200,000 cubic feet of Indiana limestone and granite, 10 million bricks, and 730 tons of aluminum and stainless steel.


If someone was able to find the densities of all of these materials they could do similar calculations to find the volume…possibly more accurate!
